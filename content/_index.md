Hello, I'm João Fernandes, currently pursuing my PhD in mathematics at KIT in Karlsruhe. My research centers on topological methods in geometry and their connections to higher categorical structures. I'm broadly interested in how abstract mathematical frameworks can reveal deep insights into the nature of space and structure.
